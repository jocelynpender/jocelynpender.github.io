I am a Biodiversity Data Scientist living in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Currently, I work at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. I am interested in how data science can support the preservation of biodiversity.

I spend a lot of time volunteering with Girl Guides of Canada. I enjoy using my leadership skills to empower girls.
