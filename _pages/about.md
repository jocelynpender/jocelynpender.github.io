I am a Biodiversity Data Scientist living in Sackville, New Brunswick, Canada.

Currently, I work at the [Atlantic Canada Conservation Data Centre](http://accdc.com/) as a Conservation Data Analyst. I am interested in how data science can support the preservation of biodiversity.

I spend a lot of time volunteering with Girl Guides of Canada. I enjoy using my leadership skills to empower girls.

Recently, I was awarded the 5 year [Ontario Volunteer Service award](https://www.ontario.ca/page/honours-and-awards) for my work with Girl Guides of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario.
