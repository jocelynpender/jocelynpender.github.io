I am a Biodiversity Data Scientist living in Sackville, New Brunswick, Canada.

Currently, I work at the [Atlantic Canada Conservation Data Centre](http://accdc.com/) as a Conservation Data Analyst. I am interested in how data science can support the preservation of biodiversity.

I spend a lot of time volunteering with Girl Guides of Canada. I enjoy using my leadership skills to empower girls.

Recently, I was awarded the 5 year Ontario Volunteer Service award for my work with Girl Guides of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario.

I was selected to participate in the [2021 Dr. Roberta Bondar Career Development Program](https://www.wct-fct.com/en/programs/dr-roberta-bondar-stem-career-development-program).

Last summer, I was grateful for the opportunity to provide advice to young Botany students as [a panellist in the Career in Botany Luncheon](https://botany.org/home/careers-jobs/careers-in-botany/careers_in_botany_profiles.html#pender).
