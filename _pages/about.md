I am a **Biodiversity Data Scientist** living in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Currently, I work at the Atlantic Canada Conservation Data Centre as a Conservation Data Analyst. I am interested in how data science can support the **preservation of biodiversity**.

I spend a lot of time volunteering with **Girl Guides of Canada**. I enjoy using my leadership skills to empower girls.
